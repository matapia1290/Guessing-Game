Guessing Game Project 
I created this project to work buld off a guessing number project i made in Visual Studio Code. My goal was to take a console commands display to a much more UI friendly expiernce.
Unity provided the tools for that and what came was more learning where down the line i will consider more more 2D projects over 3D projects down the line.

If you would like to give my game a try please feel free to do so. I welcome all feedback to work towards a more improved project.

Thank you for reading and Thank you for playing!
